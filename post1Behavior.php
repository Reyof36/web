      <p> new to cat-parenting? You’d find yourself wondering, “why is my cat so attached to me?” </p>
      <h4>Reasons Why Cats Are Clingy</h4>
      <br>
      <h4> 1.A connection with you</h4>
      <p>A cat ever so attached to you from the get-go perhaps had a connection with you. The connection
         can be founded on various reasons that highly involves your cat's feelings towards you. Perhaps,
         your cat feels secure with you more than anyone else, that's why it has grown to become attached
         to you.<br>
     <br> It is also good to know that perhaps you and your cat share some sort of a trust bond so strong
          wherein your cat does not even want to share this bond with anyone else but you.</p>

      <br>
      <h4> 2.A safety net</h4>
      <p> Some cats can be tensed and uneasy most of the time, and they found a safety net in you.
          Cats may have feelings of insecurity and vulnerability and they may look up to you as their
          human benefactors and guardians.</p>

      <br>
      <h4> 3.Weaned too early</h4>
      <p> Usually, if a kitten was weaned too early from its mother, it will continue to seek a mother
          figure. The next living thing it encounters will perhaps make way for the cat to start building
          an attachment to it. This explains why strays become more attached to its new cat parents.</p>

      <br>
      <h4> 4.They are rescue cats</h4>
      <p> Did it ever occur to you that their attachment to you is their way of saying thank you to all
          the things that you have done for them? Well, in this case, rescued cats tend to be more attached
          to their rescuer; as if telling them that they owe their lives to their rescuer. It is also apparent
          that rescue cats tend to become overly clingy – meaning more loving and affectionate! This is perhaps
          how they show their appreciation for what you have done for them. </p>

      <br>
      <h4> 5.May have something to do with their breed</h4>
      <p> Many cat parents would share how they saw a pattern in their cats on who is more attached to them.
          They have this theory where it all boils down to the cat’s breed: Siberians, Norwegian Forest Cats,
          Russian Blues, Bengals, Bombays, and Himalayans are known to be quite a clingwrap to their cat parents.</p>

      <br>
      <h4> 6.You got what it needs</h4>
      <p> Well, unfortunately sometimes it is not about all that has been mentioned. Sometimes it is simply
          because you have what they need in order to survive. Quite a bit harsh, but the reality is that they get
          something from you that’s why your cat is so attached to you.</p>

      <br>
      <h4> 7.Time to talk to your vet!</h4>
      <p> Maybe it is your cat’s way of saying that something is wrong with them. Being attached to you is their
          communication tool to get their message across. This is q highly probable case especially if the attachment
          came too sudden.</p>
