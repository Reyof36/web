  <br>
  <p> Are you deciding to keep a pet? Well, choosing between a cat, dog or any other animal is engaging.<br>

 <br> Each of these animals is different. However, cats are a fantastic choice for pets due to their adorable
      antics and cleanliness.<br>

<br>  When looking to develop animals network in your home, cats are your best bet. Here’s the reason why:

<br>
<br>

<h4> 1. Cats Don’t Take Much Space </h4>
<p> Cats don’t need a lot of space to survive. You need enough space to fit a litter box, food and water dishes.
    Don’t let your cats share litter boxes.</p>

<h4> 2.Cats are Quieter</h4>
<p> Cats rarely make any noise at night. In fact, when the cat is active, the purrs and meows are quiet.<br>

<br>If you develop animals network, you’ll be able to distinguish different types of meows. In this way, you
    won’t give your cat food when the meow is asking for a cuddling session.</p>

<h4>3.Clean </h4>
<p> Cats are good at cleaning themselves. You don’t need to waste your time washing the animal with a brush
    daily. All you need to do is clip the nails where necessary.</p>

<h4>4.Affordability</h4>
<p> Adoption fees for cats are quite low. It’s even smaller when there’s an influx of kittens in a household.
    Some people are likely to waiver the costs or give a favorable deal like adopt one, get one free.<br>
<br>After adoption, the cost of maintaining your cat is simple. You don’t need to buy expensive toys or
    undertake repair or replacement costs quite often.</p>

 <h4>5.Ease of Cleaning the Litter Box</h4>
 <p> Cats are very clean animals. One of their instincts is always to bury their pee and poops.<br>
 <br>The act helps hide the cat from any predators. However, it’s unlikely that any predator will hunt
     a cat in your house. So having a clean and neat house is among the many benefits of owning a cat.</p>

 <h4> 6.Cats Keep Pests at Bay</h4>
 <p>Cats are hunters by nature. It’s in their DNA to follow, hunt or pounce on any of their prey.<br>

<br>While you shouldn’t let your cat eat a mouse, he or she catches, having a pest-free home should be one
    of your objectives.

<br>Even better, the scent of your cat is enough to keep rodents at bay. If they detect a hunter in your
    premises, they’re less likely to enter.</p>

<h4> 7.They Understand Personal Space </h4>
<p> A cat doesn’t require your constant energy or attention. They understand the concept of personal space.
    A cat allows you to relax after a tumultuous day at work.</p>

<h4>8.Cats are Content Indoors</h4>
<p> Cats tend to be safer and happier indoors. Simply have a small opening in your home to allow for fresh air.
    However, ensure the opening isn’t large enough to let the cat leave your room.</p>

<h4> 9.Health Benefits </h4>
<p> Having a pet in your house helps reduce stress. All this has a higher impact on the quality of your life.
    However, purring by cats has therapeutic healing capabilities on human bones.</p>

<h4>10.Easy to Train</h4>
<p>Cats know how to bury their wastes. Once you bring the litter box, all you need is to show them where it is.
   Show them how to dig the clean litter by using your hands.</p>
